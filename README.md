## Pyber_Analysis Overview

We will analyze Pyber's rideshare data from 2019 and leverage compelling visualization to help address access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighboods.

## Findings

In this analysis, we specifically drilled into different aspects of the Pyber rideshare data in urban, suburban and rural city types to help identify trends in affordability and accessibilty in these city types.

Overall, our findings tell us the following:

1. Urban areas account for 62.7% of total fares in 2019, with suburban areas accounting for 30.5% of total fares and rural areas accounting for just a nominal 6.8%. (see Figure 1)
2. On the contrary, rural areas havethe highest **average fares** compared to compared to suburban and urban areas.  (Figure 2 & Figure 3)
3. Furthermore, rural areas have the lowest number of **driver counts**of the three city types.  This is an indication that the extremely low supply of drivers could be increasing the price in the rural area (2.6%). (Figure 4 & Figure 5)
4. In the summary table below(Figure 6), we've summarized similar observations raised above.

In the rideshare industry, there is a clear trend that speaks to the supply (concentration) of drivers vs average fare -- sometimes even driven by peak hours.  In basic economic terms, a higher supply typically drives down price and can therefore drive up demand because price is perceived as more accessible.

If we were to compare the rideshare data across the industry, we might arrive at similar observations in the cross examinations. In urban areas, generally there are more demand for rides because there's a much higher percentage of people compared to suburbs and rural areas to not own a vehicle hence higher demand than you would see in suburbs and rural areas.

In Figure 6 (Summary Table), we can see that the **Average Fare per Ride** is highest in rural reas where it is the lowest in dense areas.  This, however, does not tell out the average distance traveled. We may need to further examine if average fare per mile is higher in rural areas because of low driver supply or if the higher fare is a function of distance traveled because target destinations can be more spread out in rural areas.
